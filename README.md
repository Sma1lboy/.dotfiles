### The feature I like

I didn't change to much for my vim configuration, the main idea of my vim configuration is keep thing simple for cloud develope

- Relative number
- Vim-Plug - Plugin Manager and Installer
- Vim-lsp-settings - Easier way to setup LSP
- Auto completion with tab selection
- Auto-Pairs

When get into language, try  `:LspInstallServer` or check [vim-lsp-settings](https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings) to get LSP service

if you need linter or formatter, then add by yourself. I want to keep vim config clean, simple and easy to use.
