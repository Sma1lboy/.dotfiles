# Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for various tools I use in my development environment. Below you will find a brief overview of each configuration file and a space for custom command descriptions.

Works for MacOS/Linux ðŸ’» (no windows)

# Quick Installation

The installation process has been greatly simplified! Now you can set up everything with just one command:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sma1lboy/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

# Make the start script executable
chmod +x start.sh

# Run the start script
./start.sh
```

The `start.sh` script will automatically:

- Install required dependencies for your OS (macOS or Linux)
- Set up Neovim, tmux, and other configurations
- Install ZSH plugins
- Configure window manager (Aerospace for macOS)
- Create symbolic links for all configuration files

> Note: For macOS users, it will install Homebrew packages including coreutils, lazygit, fastfetch, and window management tools.

## Installing Dependencies Only

If you only want to install the required dependencies without configuring dotfiles, you can use:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x script/preinstall.sh

# Run the preinstall script
./script/preinstall.sh
```

### Currently Supported Software (macOS)

The preinstall script will install the following tools for macOS:

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Homebrew
- git
- tmux
- neofetch
- node
- neovim
- gcc
- coreutils
- lazygit
- fastfetch
- Aerospace window manager
- JankyBorders

> **Note**: Yabai, skhd, and sketchybar are currently disabled in the installation script as Yabai is not fully compatible with newer macOS versions. The project now uses Aerospace as the primary window manager instead.

## .config/nvim

This directory contains my Neovim configuration files.

### The feature I like

I didn't change to much for my vim configuration, the main idea of my vim configuration is keep thing simple for cloud develope

- Relative number
- Vim-Plug - Plugin Manager and Installer
- Vim-lsp-settings - Easier way to setup LSP
- Auto completion with tab selection
- Auto-Pairs

When get into language, try `:LspInstallServer` or check [vim-lsp-settings](https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings) to get LSP service

if you need linter or formatter, then add by yourself. I want to keep vim config clean, simple and easy to use.

**Custom Commands:**
